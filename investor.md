# Investor Brief (CEO Version)

## 1) What this company does

We run a digital agriculture-commerce platform that connects:
- **Farm-focused suppliers/distributors** who list products
- **Customers** who buy those products online
- **Our operations team** who manages quality, approvals, and fulfillment visibility

In simple terms: we are building the online marketplace and operating system for agricultural products.

---

## 2) Why this matters

Agriculture supply chains are still fragmented and inefficient in many regions. Buyers struggle with trust, consistency, and visibility. Sellers struggle with distribution and predictable demand.

Our platform solves this by:
- Standardizing digital product listings and storefronts
- Creating a single buying experience for customers
- Giving distributors a managed onboarding path
- Giving management live control over catalog, orders, and payouts

---

## 3) Business model (how we make money)

Primary and potential revenue streams:
- **Transaction margin/commission** on orders
- **Distributor service fees** (optional premium tools/placement)
- **Logistics/fulfillment value-added services** (if enabled)
- **B2B bulk supply channels** for institutional buyers

This creates recurring transactional revenue with room for higher-margin service layers.

---

## 4) What is already built

The system already supports core commercial operations:
- Customer registration, login, shopping cart, checkout, order tracking
- Distributor registration and approval workflow
- Distributor product management and revenue request workflow
- Admin/employee back office for product, category, user, order, and payout control
- News/content module for brand and market communication

This means the business has a usable digital core, not just a prototype screen.

---

## 5) Strategic advantage

Our advantage is operational control + marketplace flexibility:
- Multi-role platform (customer, distributor, admin, employee)
- Controlled approvals to maintain quality and trust
- Built-in workflow for distributor payouts
- Modular architecture that can expand to new regions/categories

This supports disciplined scaling rather than uncontrolled marketplace growth.

---

## 6) Growth plan (next 12–24 months)

High-level roadmap:
1. **Supply expansion**: onboard more reliable distributors and product categories
2. **Demand growth**: strengthen customer acquisition and retention channels
3. **Unit economics**: optimize order value, repeat rate, and fulfillment efficiency
4. **Geographic scale**: replicate the model into nearby high-demand markets
5. **Data advantage**: use demand/price insights to improve inventory and margin

---

## 7) Key metrics leadership should track

Non-technical KPI set for board/investor updates:
- Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)
- Net revenue
- Order count and repeat purchase rate
- Active distributors and approval-to-activation rate
- Average order value (AOV)
- Fulfillment time and cancellation rate
- Contribution margin per order

---

## 8) Risk areas and mitigation

Main risks:
- Supply inconsistency
- Logistics/service quality
- Margin pressure in competitive categories
- Regulatory/compliance changes

Current mitigation approach:
- Controlled distributor approval
- Centralized admin oversight for catalog and orders
- Transparent payout workflows
- Gradual category/region expansion with operational checkpoints

---

## 9) What we are asking from investors

We are seeking capital and strategic support for:
- Distributor network expansion
- Customer acquisition and brand growth
- Operations/fulfillment strengthening
- Product and analytics improvements

Goal: build a trusted, scalable agri-commerce platform with durable transaction revenue and long-term market leadership potential.
